# zarr-gl

Custom WebGL Zarr layer for Mapbox and Maplibre.

This library allows you to load [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) data into a [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) or [Maplibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) map.

Takes inspiration from [carbonplan/maps](https://github.com/carbonplan/maps), but with two differences:
1. A library, rather than a framework, so you can use it how you like.
2. Adds a [Custom Layer](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/properties/#customlayerinterface) to Mapbox's GL context, rather than creating a whole separate one. Allows you to mix and match with Map styles, adjust layer ordering etc.

You can see a demo at: [rainy.rdrn.me](http://rainy.rdrn.me).

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install zarr-gl
```

You'll need to prepare the data using [carbonplan/ndpyramid](https://github.com/carbonplan/ndpyramid).
Maybe one day this won't be necessary, but re-projecting arrays on the fly isn't cheap.
There's a basic data preparation example at [example/prep.py](./example/prep.py).

```js
import { ZarrLayer } from "zarr-gl";
// or skip the npm install and just do this:
// import { ZarrLayer } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/zarr-gl@0.2.0/+esm";

const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  container: "map",
  style: "mapbox://styles/mapbox/standard",
  projection: "mercator",
});

const layer = new ZarrLayer({
  id: "myZarrLayer",
  source: "https://example.com/path/to/my.zarr",
  variable: "precip",
  colormap: [[200, 10, 50], [30, 40, 30], [50, 10, 200]],
  vmin: 0,
  vmax: 100,
  opacity: 0.8,
  map,
});
map.addLayer(layer);
```

## Roadmap
- [x] Support a `selector` option to index into additional dimensions. Currently only 2D datasets are supported.
- [ ] Handle chunk sizes other than 128x128.
- [ ] Appropriately handle non-float32 data.
- [ ] Add more lifecycle events.

## Examples
1. There is a very basic example (including data prep) in the [example](./example) directory.
2. There's also a more complex React app inside [demo](./demo) and viewable at [rainy.rdrn.me](http://rainy.rdrn.me).

## Contributing
I'd love input on use-cases, ideas, missing features etc.
Even better if they come with code.
